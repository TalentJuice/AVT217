		<p>When it comes to simplicity I think her website does a great job at being as simple as possible leaving only a 3 column grid, a logotype and navigation buttons, and even going as far as discarding the transition between a navigation bar and main website. She still retains satisfaction with highlighted navigation buttons and images that when hovered paint a clearer picture of their purpose. My only gripe is a random “Grandpa Online” button that sends you nowhere. This website has so much beauty underneath in my opinion. The posters and photo tabs have striking moving images that elevate the user experience and is something I haven’t seen before. Furthermore, the hovering of images stated above I think contributes to the hidden beauty of the website. This website in my opinion has compelling form and color agreement due to its stark black background contrasted with a variety of bright vibrantly colored merchandise designs and white logo. As for approachable innovation I think what was innovative to me was the choice to have a completely black and not dark gray background. I think it becomes approachable with the imagery.</p>

		<p>His website is a good example of simple and clean with a nice 4 column grid, a minimal nav bar, and well-spaced images and text. Even while being so minimal it remains extremely satisfying. Animated nav buttons, fully embedded YouTube tutorial links that don’t send you to a new page, and an easy to understand contact page. This website is also chock full of beauty underneath. One of my favorite features is the central image on the webpage that has a bar that can be pushed and pulled revealing a before and after. To top it off although there are navigation buttons the entire website is surprisingly a single page. This webpage has good form and color agreement in that it follows a trend of sharp angular designs and dark gray background. Moreover, the bright yellow-orange color in the about page assists in this aspect. I think this website has approachable innovation due to the way the videos are embedded. They are linked directly to YouTube opening a sub tab/layout that highlights the video while displaying the other videos at a reduced size. </p>

		<h2><a href="https://www.sawyerhartman.com" title="Sawyer Hartman's Portfolio" target="_blank">Sawyer Hartman</a></h2>
		<img src="critique/portfolio3.png" alt="Sawyer Hartman's Portfolio">
		<p>The overall website is simple and clean with its equal column grids, “stuck” to the top nav bar and minimal layout. Everything is clear to the user and doesn’t lack any functionality. That being said, I do have an issue with the amount of different typefaces used that tend to distract me as I scroll through the page. One unique thing I enjoyed was the main image having enough horizontal width to reach both ends of a wider screen like the one I use, my only issue was that there were some clear artifcating issues as a result. Even with some of these gripes there is still beauty underneath. At the bottom of the page there is an automatic scrolling reel of images that show off Hartman’s photography. I think this adds interest to the page where it may be lacking. On a side note his gallery page is his strongest with large striking images laid out in a harmonious 2 column grid. The webpages form color agreement is nothing out of the ordinary with mostly black and white broken up with the colorful pictures. The website functionally does everything you’d expect from a portfolio but doesn’t really innovate much outside of maybe the scrolling images. (After checking on my phone I confirmed my suspicion that the website was built for mobile browsing due to its low resolution images and a lack of srcset images)</p>

		<h2><a href="https://www.devinsupertramp.com" title="Devin Graham's Portfolio" target="_blank">Devin Graham</a></h2>
		<img src="critique/portfolio4.png" alt="Devin Graham's Portfolio">
		<p>This website check off the box for simplicity with a well aligned 3/6 column grid system, a limited color palette, nice large nav bar, and quality central and supplementary images. It still retains its satisfaction with nav button drop downs and underlines dependent on your page and images that redirect to other pages which I feel is a necessity. This portfolio really puts its beauty underneath on full display with its massive gif image of water slowly crashing into giant glaciers/rocks. This central image also fits into the color scheme well with its black and white text and background accented with blue gray accents for holding boxes such as the nav bar. Overall 
			Simple yet effective. The innovation for this portfolio truly is the gif image. Its bold and immediately draws the viewer’s attention and I am yet to see something else like it.</p>

		<img src="critique/portfolio5.png" alt="Alicia Haberman's Portfolio">
		<p>This websites homepage as well as its other pages are simply filled with images that span across the page without any margins. It maintains its satisfaction by having a clean nav bar with highlighted buttons when on a page and a larger logo that returns you to “home.” This portfolio unfortunately has very little beauty underneath outside of it having a variable amount of columns based on the screen size which helps with its responsiveness across devices. The overall form color agreement is at first simple with its white background and black text. That is elevated though by its large colorful images on each of the pages which help to break up the space. There unfortunately really isn’t any approachable innovation within the design of this layout. Everything is quite standard but it still does a good job of meeting its desired goals.</p>
